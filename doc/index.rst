Ansys Open Source Developer's Guide
===================================
Welcome to the *Ansys Open Source Developer's Guide*.

In the spirit of open source, we're publishing this guide on creating
open source projects for Ansys products, tools, and libraries that
benefit our Ansys community. We hope you find this guide useful.
